# code-tech-task-2
overview of the project to develop a Python program for managing student grades:

Objective:
Create a Python program that tracks, manages, and calculates student grades efficiently. The program should allow users to:

Input grades for various subjects or assignments.
Calculate the average grade.
Display the overall grade with additional information like letter grades or GPA.
Features:
Grade Input:

Users can enter grades for specific subjects or assignments.
Accept multiple grades and associate them with respective subjects or assignment names.
Average Calculation:

Automatically calculate the average of all entered grades.
Grade Display:

Show the calculated average.
Convert the average to a letter grade (A, B, C, D, F).
Optionally, calculate and display GPA based on a standard grading scale.
User Interface:

Text-based menu system for input and navigation.
Allow users to view, update, or delete grades if needed.
Error Handling:

Validate inputs to ensure grades are numeric and within an acceptable range (e.g., 0â€“100).
Handle invalid inputs gracefully.
Potential Additional Features:
Weighted Grades: Allow the user to assign weights to assignments (e.g., final exam = 40%, homework = 20%).

Student Profiles: Track grades for multiple students by allowing the creation and management of student profiles.

Export/Import: Save grades and calculations to a file (e.g., CSV or JSON) and load them for future use.

Graphical Representation: Display grades using visual tools like bar charts or pie charts (optional).

Structure and Workflow:
Input:

Prompt the user to input subject/assignment names and grades.
Allow updates or corrections.
Processing:

Calculate the average grade.
Determine the corresponding letter grade or GPA.
Output:

Display grades, average, letter grade, and/or GPA.
Provide clear options to exit or perform other actions.
Tools and Libraries:
Built-in Python Libraries: For basic functionalities.
Optional Libraries:
matplotlib or seaborn for graphs.
pandas for handling grade data efficiently.
